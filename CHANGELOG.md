## Change Log

# 1.0.7

- added the `DiffTransform` stage - a stage which efficiently calculutes the difference between two datasets and produces left, right and intersection output views.
- updated the `EqualityValidate` to use the `hash` diffing function as the inbuilt `except` function is very difficult to use in practice. API unchanged.

# 1.0.6

- updated `AzureEventHubsLoad` to use a SNAPSHOT compiled JAR in `/lib` to get latest changes. this will be changed back to Maven once version is officially released. Also exposed the expontential retry options to API.
- initial testing of a `.zip` reader/writer.

# 1.0.5

- fix a longstanding defect in `TypingTranform` not correctly passing through values which are already of correct type.
- change the `_index` field added to `*Extract` from `monotonically_increasing_id()` to a `row_number(monotonically_increasing_id())` so that the index aligns to underlying files and is more intuitive to use.

# 1.0.4

- allow passing of same metadata schema to `JSONExtract` and `XMLExtract` to reduce cost of schema inference for large number of files.

# 1.0.3

- Expose numPartitions Optional Parameter for `*Extract`.

# 1.0.2

- add sql validation step to `SQLValidate` configuration parsing and ensure parameters are injected first (including `SQLTransform`) so the statements with parameters can be parsed.

# 1.0.1

- bump to Spark 2.3.1.

# 1.0.0

- initial release.

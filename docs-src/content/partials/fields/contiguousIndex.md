When loading a file two additional `metadata` fields are added to each record: `_filename` and `_index` (row number in the file). These fields are automatically included as they are very useful when trying to understand where certain data came from when consuming the data downstream.<br><br>The computational cost of adding the `_index` column in a distributed execution engine like Spark means that sometimes it is not worth the time/expense of precisely resolving the row number. By setting `contiguousIndex` equal to `false` Spark will include a different field `_monotonically_increasing_id` which is a non-sequential/non-contiguous identifier from which `_index` can be derived later but will not incur the same cost penalty of resolving `_index`.<br><br>Default: true.

A map of the fields to be passed to the TensorFlow Serving service. This map describes the required input fields and their type and will be used to extract the correct field from the Spark `DataFrame` (by name). E.g. a to call a TensorFlow Serving instance which requires an input of `customer_usage` of type `DT_DOUBLE` this map will be used to take the field `customer_usage` from `inputView` and create the required request of data type `DT_DOUBLE`. For this stage to work the `customer_usage` type within Spark must be of `DoubleType`.
